### 👨‍💻 Who Am I?

- 🧠 Breaking stuff to understand how it works  
- 💣 Training my machine to be smarter than me (aka ML)  
- 🔐 Studied networking and cryptography – because why sleep when you can read RFCs?  
- 🕶️ A sprinkle of cybersecurity – enough to know never to click random email links

### 🙅‍♂️ Things I Avoid:

- 🚫 JavaScript frameworks  
- 🤖 Anything with "AI-powered" in the title  
- 📝 Writing documentation
