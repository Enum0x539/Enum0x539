### 👨‍💻 Who Am I?

- 🧠 Breaking stuff to understand how it works  
- 💣 Training my machine to be smarter than me (aka ML)  
- 🔐 Studied networking and cryptography – because why sleep when you can read RFCs?  
- 🕶️ A sprinkle of cybersecurity – enough to know never to click random email links  

---

### 🎯 Unreasonable Goals
 
- ⚙️ Contribute to a project that has no UI
- 🚫 Never use the same bug twice
- 🤖 Resist the urge to "AI-power" everything. Not every script needs a chatbot, Karen.
- 🦄 Build something totally useless that somehow goes viral
- 🧩 Reverse-engineer my own code after 3 months of forgetting what it does
- 🧟‍♀️ Use Windows API “undocumented” tricks that Microsoft forgot to tell you about 

## 🤖 Philosophy

- If it compiles, ship it  
- If it doesn’t compile, blame the compiler  
- If it works but you don’t know why… leave it  
- Comments are just documentation that went rogue  
- Documentation is a myth invented by project managers
